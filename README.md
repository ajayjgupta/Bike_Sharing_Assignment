# Project Name
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

- Bivariate Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Model Building
- Fine tuning Model
- Summary of the all the analysis

## Conclusions
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes can focus more on Temperature
- We can see demand for bikes was more in 2019 than 2018, so just focus as there is increase in 2019 and might be facing dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic and by the time it reduces the things will be better
- Can focus more  on Summer & Winter season, August, September month, Weekends, Working days as they have good influence on bike rentals.
- We can see spring season has negative coefficients and negatively correlated to bike rentals. So we can give some offers there to increase the demand
- Now seeing to weathersit variable, we have got negative coefficients for Mist +cloudy and Lightsnow weather... And yes we can give offers
